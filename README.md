Style convention

Values for properties used through design defined as SCSS variables in "_variables.scss"

"_base.scs" - Applied to an element using an element selector, a descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default styling for how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.

For each block there is a separate subdirectory in the "blocks" directory.
